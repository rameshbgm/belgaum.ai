# Belgaum.ai - Detailed Knowledge Repository

## Who is Belgaum.ai?
Belgaum.ai is a pioneering AI Orchestration startup based in the historic city of Belgaum, Karnataka, India. We are dedicated to building a comprehensive AI ecosystem that empowers educational institutions and corporate enterprises through cutting-edge intelligent workflows.

## Our Three Strategic Pillars

### 1. AI Education (EduTech)
We transform traditional learning environments into GenAI-native ecosystems. 
- Main Focus: Deploying Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for universities and schools.
- Knowledge Bases: We help institutions digitize their libraries into searchable vector bases.
- Socratic Tutors: We develop LLM-powered tutors that guide students through logic rather than just giving answers.
- Personalized Learning: Our systems adapt to individual student learning styles—visual, auditory, or text-heavy.

### 2. AI Development (Industrial Workflows)
We build autonomous systems that solve complex business logic.
- Agentic Workflows: We go beyond chat. Our agents plan, self-correct, and execute multi-step tasks.
- Tech Stack: We use frameworks like LangGraph, CrewAI, and LlamaIndex to build these agents.
- Data Memory: We use vector databases like Pinecone and ChromaDB for long-term AI memory.
- Optimization: We specialize in sub-second inference, ensuring AI responses are near-instant.

### 3. Corporate Training (Upskilling)
We prepare the global workforce for an AI-first world.
- Implementation Labs: Hands-on labs where teams build ROI-driven AI solutions.
- Professional Prompting: Advanced training on engineering the perfect context for LLMs.
- Operations Design: We help companies redesign their business processes to be AI-augmented.
- Governance: We establish strict AI policies focusing on security, privacy, and ethical deployment.

## Technical Capabilities
- Logic Models: OpenAI o1, GPT-4o-mini, Claude 3.5.
- Speech: High-fidelity voice bots using Whisper and ElevenLabs.
- Integration: Deep connectors for legacy CRMs, ERPs, and custom databases.
- Infrastructure: Scalability via Docker and Kubernetes.
